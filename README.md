# ANSWERS: Adjustment for Network Spillover in Stepped-Wedge-based Experimental Rollouts and Studies

**ANSWERS** is an R-based toolkit for quantifying and adjusting for spillover effects in stepped-wedge clinical trials using physician social networks. It supports network-informed exposure calculation and provides outputs ready for use in regression models that account for contamination due to social proximity.

This package helps trialists *get ANSWERS* when treatment effects aren't contained by design.

## What It Does

- Computes weighted adjacency matrices for each trial step
- Calculates physician-level exposure to spillover using pre/post intervention data
- Supports summary of exposure at the **patient level** for those treated by multiple physicians
- Returns step-wise exposure vectors for integration into downstream statistical models

---

## Core Method

Spillover is estimated via a matrix multiplication of a normalized adjacency matrix and an indicator vector reflecting intervention status. Optional steps allow aggregation across multiple treating physicians per patient using customizable summary functions (e.g., sum, mean, max).

## Repository Contents

- **`Create_Spillover_Networks.R`**  
  Generates physician social networks from billing data and computes a time-varying spillover metric for each physician across trial steps.

- **`Make_Spillover_Variables.R`**  
  Aggregates physician-level spillover exposure to the patient level based on encounters during a hospital stay. Output is formatted for use in downstream statistical modeling.

- **`Spillover_Models.Rmd`**  
  Contains analysis code for fitting models using the spillover variables and formatting model results for interpretation and reporting.
